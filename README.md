Mini Logbook
This single-screen application is designed to help users monitor and track their blood glucose (BG) levels. It provides a simple, intuitive interface for logging values, viewing historical data, and seeing an updated average. The app is built to be flexible and user-friendly, accommodating different measurement units and ensuring data integrity.

Features
Unit Selection: The user can easily switch between mmol/L and mg/dL for their BG values.

Data Entry: A numeric keyboard allows for quick and accurate entry of BG values, with validation to ensure the value is greater than or equal to 0.

Real-time Unit Display: A label next to the input field dynamically updates to show the selected unit.

Value Logging: When the "Save" button is pressed, the entered value is stored, and the displayed average BG value is instantly updated.

Value Persistence: The app is designed to either keep values in memory or, for extra points, persist them across sessions.

Input Management: The text input field is automatically cleared after a successful save, streamlining the data entry process.

Data Visualization: Previously entered values are displayed in a clear and suitable format, allowing users to review their history at a glance.

Unit Conversion: Changing the unit automatically converts and updates all displayed values and labels. The conversion factor is 1 mmol/L = 18.0182 mg/dL.

Robust Code: The application includes proper measures to ensure the code is correct and works as intended.

Flexible UI: While a mockup is provided, the UI is designed to be flexible, allowing the use of native components to create the most effective user experience.
